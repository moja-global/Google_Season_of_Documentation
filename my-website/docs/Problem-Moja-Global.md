title: The problem
---
Right now, new users experience difficulty understanding how moja global projects can be used or are interrelated. Last year, our GSoD efforts led to the development of a website to onboard new contributors, a ReadTheDocs environment for our technical documentation, and completed documentation for the moja global Reporting Tool. We’d now like to extend these resources and by adding easy to follow examples of how the FLINT works and can be used with other tools to our documentation and contributors websites.

The primary goals of this project are to:

-   Standardize documentation across all of our repositories and improve navigation between moja global projects
-   Promote user documentation on how to conduct and configure FLINT using the JSON configuration application.
-   Migrate our control flow and architecture diagrams to our contributor’s site making it accessible to a wide audience
-   Create a list of available FLINT modules for users to customise their land use change models.
-   Publish a tutorial on how to post-process the FLINT results using the moja global Visualisation and Reporting tools.

In order to facilitate a higher volume of documentation and communications, we also propose to develop a system for publishing case studies in addition to our technical documentation. We would like to add markdown documents to our contributors website for thematic discussions that appeal to a wide range of audiences.
