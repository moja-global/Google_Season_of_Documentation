We seek two technical writers to work with moja global during the Google Season of Docs period. The first writer will audit our existing user, developer and policy focused documentation and develop a content strategy, including case studies, to improve the experience of new users. The second writer will work on standardising our developer documentation, setting up a static-site generator for rendering markdown documents, and migrating our existing documentation onto our Readthedocs reference site.  Both writers will be responsible for improving the user and developer experience by adding, enhancing or migrating documentation wherever needed.
