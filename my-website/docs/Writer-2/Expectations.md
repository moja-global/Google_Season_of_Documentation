title: Expectations
---

Writer #2 will work with mentors Sneha Mishra (contributors website developer, ReadTheDocs maintainer, and GSoD 2020 graduate!) and Dr. Andrew Oâ€™Reilly-Nugent (TSC Director) to organise our technical and developer documentation. This will involve collaboration with the Documentation Working Group, moja global brand management partners at Climate Advisors, and the maintainers of moja global projects. Writer #2 will need a keen eye for detail and great instincts for designing a pain-free documentation experience. Web development experience is not required, but would be a bonus if it enabled Writer #2 to take the lead on the provisioning of a static site generator, with support from other moja global developers.

-   Update the existing contributors website:
	- Work with our UI/UX and communications experts to add content and improve navigation.
	 - Use a static site generator to render markdown content and add this to the contributors websites.
	 - Document the process for adding content to the contributors website.

-   Prepare documentation on setting up configuration files:
	 - Audit moja global projects repositories and associated documentation to assess conformance with the moja global style guide.
	 - Transcribe the control flow and system architecture diagrams from LucidChart to a Web Component.
	- Design and visualize a map of moja global repositories and services.

-   Plan a migration of existing documentation onto our ReadTheDocs platform:
	 - Update the moja global [ReadTheDocs](https://github.com/moja-global/moja_global_docs) README and provide common instructions for submitting documentation.
	 - Publish the content strategy and contribution workflows for new documentation on ReadTheDocs.
	- Coordinate the migration of existing documentation for the FLINT, Reporting Tool, Taswari, GBCM and JSON application onto ReadTheDocs.
