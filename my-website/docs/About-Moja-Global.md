Help fight climate change from your keyboard! Moja global provides tools for estimating emissions and removals of greenhouse gases (GHG) from the land sector. The Full Lands INtegration Tool also known as FLINT, available under MPL-2.0 License, is a platform developed by the moja global team for data collection, analysis and continuous improvement of greenhouse gas inventories related to land use and land use change at local, national and global scales.

The FLINT is based on over 20 years of experience building and operating measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) tools in Australia and Canada. The FLINT provides the capability to quickly establish an operational MRV system that can respond to policy making and planning needs. The FLINT has been designed to achieve the required accuracy through step-by-step improvements.

New FLINT users are expected to follow the IPCC guidelines to develop increasingly accurate and robust systems for greenhouse gas accounting. Users are supported by moja global, a vibrant developer community, and philanthropic partners like the UNFCCC and IUCN. We hope to grow the number of institutional users to 14 countries by 2023 and require excellent communication, education and documentation across a wide range of topics including science, policy and software development.

Moja global has hosted mentees from Google Summer of Code, Season of Documentation, The Linux Foundation and has been accepted into Outreachy. The Mentorship Working Group can put interested applicants in contact with previous mentees and mentors as needed.
