## Executive Summary
### Summary
moja global is capitalizing on open source development to produce tools that can support Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) systems for the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use sector (AFOLU). Open source derives its strength from collaboration between users. This White Paper highlights that by sharing through open source, all parties gain. This is achieved through contributing to the understanding of open source practices in general and moja global procedures in particular. 

### Definitions
- **Open source** refers to software for which the source code is available. This allows anybody to inspect, modify, and distribute the software and derived products. Sharing the source code allows users to make improvements that are shared back with the community of users. The obligation to share back is often included in the licence of the open source project. 

- **Ecosystem** refers to all the users, contributors, businesses, service providers, resellers, reviewers, etc that interact with the software as well as with each other. The success of open source software is now measured by the strength of its ecosystem. Many of these people are paid by their company or organisation to work on the open source project. 

- **FLINT** (Full Lands Integration Tool) is an open source platform that integrates multiple data types (including remote sensing products) with FLINT-compatible modules to produce spatially-explicit calculations of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals as well as other variables. FLINT is designed to overcome some key challenges AFOLU MRV is facing, including: Reducing cost and expertise to design, implement and maintain AFOLU MRV. Providing a flexible framework for consistently combining components of the MRV system. Allowing iterative upgrading of components while maintaining the coherence of the overall system. Sharing lessons between new and experienced users without being forced to leapfrog to the most sophisticated version of the tool. 

- moja global is a project under the Linux Foundation that provides the technical and governance infrastructure that facilitates ecosystem collaboration on tools that contribute to sustainable land management. The FLINT is one of the software tools and other tools are welcomed. The Linux Foundation umbrella provides the legal entity, human resource management, accounting, and infrastructure.

### Use of open source and moja global tools
Open source is growing at an exponential rate and now 98% of all software is built on open source components. Open source is preferred because it:
- Delivers better quality, faster innovation, fewer bugs, more features
- Prevents vendor lock-in
- Can be customized and fixed by users
- Facilitates deployment and interoperability
- Has a better cost benefit ratio

Governments have some additional reasons to adopt open source tools:
- Open source collaboration reduces the demand on government experts 
- Open source reduces donor dependency and supports sustainability
- Open source provides access to advanced tools to governments who can't afford to develop bespoke systems
- Open source provides a transparent platform for public-private collaboration in the development of tools to support public policy needs

Companies have few remaining obstacles to open source adoption, mainly the lack of support and poor documentation. Governments seem to be slower in adopting open source tools because officials have a general lack of awareness of open source applications, its principles, its licensing, and its practices. Other barriers to adoption include employee resistance to leaving proprietary software, vendor lock-in, limited technical competence, and institutional barriers to updating policies regarding intellectual property. Many governments are developing policies regulating the use of open source software.
